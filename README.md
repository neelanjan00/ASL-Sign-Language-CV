# ASL-Sign-Language-CV

A webcam-based object detection model that uses an artificial neural network to label the American Sign Language (ASL) hand sign alphabets. This deep learning model makes use of the Faster-RCNN model architecture to perform the object detection, which is implemented using the Tensorflow framework.

To execute the program using webcam:
```ASL_Detection_webcam.py```
